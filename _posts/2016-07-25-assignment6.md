title: Assignment 6-Reveal Presentations
---

Being an effective and efficient presenter is more difficult than one may think. In part this is because people tend to abuse the PowerPoint presentation slide style of delivery. Instead of using it as supplemental information for the viewer to follow along with, it is used as a shorter page of speaker's notes. Or the information becomes lost in a flurry of transitions and text flourishes in an overly done attempt to keep the viewer's attention. Presentations and lectures tend to be of the "less is more" aphormism when it comes to this visual element. 

That is what this assignment is trying to do: create a well formed presentation that is not the speaker's notes thrown upon a tiny slide nor an overly done animated mess. The secondary goal is to learn how to use/create and implement this via Reveal.js and record and edit audio for a voice over. Reveal.js is a simple framework for creating presentations in HTML. The audio was recorded with phones or via [Online Voice Recorder](http://online-voice-recorder.com/), a free online recording app that allows you to record up to 7 minutes. In order to condense the files, they were converted to .ogg instead of using .wav. This project again was in collaboration with another student (or students). 

Here is the presentation that [Chris](https://chrissb8.github.io/) and I made on the [South American Pud√∫](https://nimbreitenfeld.github.io/task-6-Pudu/#/). Curious about what is going on behind the scenes? [Click Me.](https://github.com/NimBreitenfeld/task-6-Pudu)
