title: Introducing a Blog Project
---

The purpose of this blog is to learn through implementation how to adapt a Jekyll based theme into one's own website ran on <a href="https://https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and edited via the emulated terminal(s) on <a href="https://codeanywhere.com">Codeanywhere</a>.  This project is an assignment for the  Tools for Information Literacy course I am taking this summer.  Goals of the course that align with this particular project are:
<ul>
<li>Operating on a remote system</li>
<li>Using version control software to maintain your workflow</li>
<li>Manipulating and formatting text-based documents</li>
</ul>
While the content is curently a work in progress, this blog may outlive the summer session and be repurposed after the end of the course. 

This blog is using a customized version of the BlackDoc theme created by <a href="http://karloespiritu.com/">Karlo Espiritu</a>, a software designer, in order to provide a master-detail layout for the viewing of content. 

### About BlackDoc Theme
For more on this theme, head over to the creator's <a href="https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc">GitHub repository</a> to check out the `ReadMe` and download.

### About Jekyll
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is the open-source static site generator used to create this website. While Jekyll creates simple websites, it is a very durable tool --in fact it is the same site generator being used to construct GitHub Pages. For more information about Jekyll, [please check out the project on GitHub](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
