title: Assignment 5-Scripting MySQL
---

The 5th assignment for this course aimed to provide further practice with writing scripts as well as introducing databases (in particular, MySQL databases). Working in a group of 4 (Team Dogwood) we began where we left off with Assignment 4: scripting user input into a .CSV (comma seperated values) or .TSV (tab seperated values) files. The new script we wrote together takes the data collected from Assignmnet 4 and loaded it into a MySQL database, outputting a downloadable .sql file. 

Here is a link to [Assignment 4](https://github.com/NimBreitenfeld/Dogwood) where we created a survey about Pokemon Go!.

Here is a link to my fork of the repository for [Assignment 5](https://github.com/NimBreitenfeld/task-5-database-interface) in which we took the data collected in Assignment 4 and outputed a .sql (database) file.
