I recently adopted a cat, a black American shorthair fine feline with some white markings, who I named Noctis ("of night," Latin origins).  A few months before this my almost 10 year partner in crime for naps and jokes, Salizar; a wild caught and then accidently domesticated green anole; past away from being sick and really old (typical lifespan of store bought anoles apparently is only 4 or 5 years). Perhaps maybe about half a year before Salizar died, my bravest hen and escape artist, Houdini died in a successful defense against a stray neighborhood cat or aggressive possum. But, in effect, no other hen in my/my mother's flock was harmed. Today Martha, Bertha, Paprika, and Tequila are living it up in my mother's and younger sister's care in my hometown. All of my hens lay and have laid brown eggs, although occaisionally when it has been cloudy for a while or what ever reason, we do get some lighter creamy brown eggs. Dusty, brown-red with some golden markings, Martha, Bertha, and Paprika are all Rhode Island reds. Solid, slightly irredescent black with red-gold and deep-gold markings on her throat and breast, Houdini was a stunning image of the black sex-link variety. The smallest, but smartest of all of my hens, Tequila is a true chicken outlier, being somewhat of a mutt and mostly unidentifiable. Her mostly black feathers and similar markings to Houdinit indicate that she is probably part black sex-link, but Tequila's fluffiness, thick -nearly scaled- grey feet, small beak, and short rear are not indicative of any recognized breed.

Here is a few photos of them:
