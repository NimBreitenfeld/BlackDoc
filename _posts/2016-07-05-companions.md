I recently adopted a cat, a black American shorthair fine feline with some white markings, who I named Noctis ("of night," Latin origins). Noctis had been at the Orange County Animal Services (OCAS) shelter for almost over a month, prior having lived out in the wilds of Chapel Hill as a feral cat. The tip of his left ear is cut off which is how I and OCAS know that he was feral and not a stray. To be frank, there exists far too many feral and stray cats and dogs than all of the shelters combined could take in, yet their numbers continue to increase as they breed freely. In lieu of these two facts the most effective and life saving measure is to Catch, Neuter/Spay and Release (CNR).  Neutered male CNR cats have one of their ears clipped to indicate that they have been neutered, thus reducing capture redundancy. So despite his tough guy apperance and feral year, Noctis is a very chill, vocal cat who loves being petted and has a loud alien purr. I can touch his paws and pawpads, extend his claws, inspect his ears and eyes, boop his nose, catch his tail, pick him up, carry him, and even put my finger in his mouth with no problem. He is not picky with his food or litter, which after reading a number of stories about cats going balistic after a change in food or litter, I am extremely grateful for.

A few months before this my almost 10 year partner in crime for naps and jokes, Salizar; a wild caught and then accidently domesticated green anole; past away from being sick and really old (typical lifespan of store bought anoles apparently is only 4 or 5 years). Perhaps maybe about half a year before Salizar died, my bravest hen and escape artist, Houdini died in a successful defense against a stray neighborhood cat or aggressive possum. But, in effect, no other hen in my/my mother's flock was harmed. 

Today Martha, Bertha, Paprika, and Tequila are living it up in my mother's and younger sister's care in my hometown. All of my hens lay and have laid brown eggs, although occaisionally, when it has been cloudy for a while or what ever reason, we do get some lighter creamy brown eggs. Dusty, brown-red with some gold and black markings, Martha, Bertha, and Paprika are all Rhode Island Reds. Solid, slightly irredescent black with red-gold and deep-gold markings on her throat and breast, Houdini was a stunning image of the black sex-link variety. The smallest, but smartest of all of my hens, Tequila is a true chicken outlier, being somewhat of a mutt and mostly unidentifiable. Her mostly black feathers and similar markings to Houdini indicate that she is probably part black sex-link, but Tequila's fluffiness, thick -nearly scaled- grey feet, small beak, and short rear are not indicative of any recognized breed.

Here is a few photos of them:

Salizar and I kicked it off from the start, even when he was just caught. My younger sister and I found him (then I caught him) burrowed in the soil late in the year. Since it was going to be getting much colder soon and we distured him from his warm hideaway, I decided to take care of him over the winter. Come spring he and I were pretty good friends and he was in no rush to leave --I mean he had it all, warmth 24/7, water when he wanted, and an endless food supply. And as they say, the rest is history.

### The Hens

Alrighty, (going left to right in order of the photos) in the first photo: the hen barging into our house is Martha, the black one is Houdini, and the other Rhode Island Red next to Houdini is Bertha. In photo two: Houdini the black hen, Martha is upfront (she is the "mother," the hen at the top of the pecking order) followed by Bertha again, and Paprika is the darkest red hen in the back. In photo three Paprika and Bertha are investigating the screen door, and that fluffly black hen butt under the chair belongs to Tequila. Unfortunately, photo three is the only picture I have of Tequila (she is very people wary).  

### Kena

Okay, so I nearly forgot about the one goldfish I got saved from being flushed down a residence hall toilet because it's owner won it from the fair but then decided he did not actually want a fish. Long story short, Kena ended up being a jerk that bullied the black moor goldfish my sisters and I got for our mom for her birthday (her favorite) to death and then later died from eating too fast. Karma attack? Oh, I definitely think so. 

I have always had bad luck with fish.  For example, the very first fish I had was a type of guppy, I think, who I bought to study ecosystems on a smaller scale for a science project. Included with the two guppies I also got a few snails so the tank would stay clean longer. They were nice fish, truly peaceful and a bit playful with each other. The problem was the snails. For reasons I have yet to discover, the cleaner snails attacked the fish resulting in the red guppy getting an eye infection and dying and making the yellow guppy sick. One morning my mom went to the kitchen (all fish tanks are kept in the kitchen because of water changes and they can get some indirect sunlight) and saw that the tank was "empty." Investigating the missing yellow guppy, she found out that one of the snails was seriously chowing down on the yellow guppy.  I think my mom ended up saving the yellow guppy's corpse from consumption and flushed it. We threw the snails out into the garden birdbath, but for the longest time the largest cream-yellow snail stayed alive. One day it went missing from the birdbath, but none of us really cared since it was this snail that we saw actively attacking the guppies.
