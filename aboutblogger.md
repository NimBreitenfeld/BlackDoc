As hinted in the [About Blog](https://nimbreitenfeld.github.io/about/) tab, I am currently in the midst of taking an Information Science course during the summer at UNC Chapel Hill.  Starting this fall I will be a fourth year Studio Arts B.F.A major, just about ready to graduate and move on with my education and life.  My name is Nim and yes, this introduction is odd.

Earlier this summer I completed two other courses, INLS 201 (Foundations of Information Science) and JOMC 182 (graphic design), which in addition to the INLS 161 course I am currently taking, will be three-fifths of a new minor. Come the fall semester I will be applying to the UNC School of Information and Library Sciences in order to formally pick up the information science minor. Therefore this summer has been perhaps more fulfilling than most others I have had at UNC since the option to not take four courses total was not available to me. On that note, my fourth summer session course is ENG 356; British-American Fiction since WWII; coincidently also the fourth course out of five for my English minor.
